# MCStudio

MCStudio is a simple function (mcfunction) and JSON editor for Minecraft. Supports syntax highlight for both _"languages"_ and autocomplete for _mcfunction_ using [FastColoredTextBox](https://github.com/PavelTorgashov/FastColoredTextBox).

As an extra, MCStudio has a full list of the enchantments and effects up to the ones in 1.13, and a file explorer.

## Requirements

This requires at least .Net Framework 4. It's included in Windows 8, 8.1 and 10. I don't know if this works with Mono since it uses some WinApi functions.

## Important

The syntax is not fully done, I still need to work on the _sub-commands_ but that is a big task.
